# Text Summarization and Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform two key natural language processing (NLP) tasks:
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifies whether the sentiment of a given text is positive, negative, or neutral.
2. **Text Summarization**: Summarizes a lengthy text into a concise version.
